<h2>Current Position</h2>

<p>
I'm currently working as an Algorithms Engineer at Apple, Inc. in the Hardware Tech division. I primarily work on iPads and whereabouts... 
</p>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Previously, I was a data scientist at a small medical startup called <a href="https://www.astradx.com/">AstraDx</a>, based in Chestnut Hill, MA. I developed imaging-based rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) that uses machine learning for automated image analysis and interpretation.
</p>

<p>
Prior to that, I was a postdoc in the <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/fmig/">Functional and Metabolic Imaging Group</a> in the Department of Radiology at the University of Pennsylvania. My research focused on developing imaging modalities &mdash;particularly hyperpolarized (HP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT)&mdash; for earlier detection and prediction of lung pathologies. Some of the pathologies I've investigated include post-transplant lung rejection, lung cancer, and radiation induced lung injury.
</p>

<p>
My PhD thesis was in the same field under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g20000343/p13700">Dr. Rahim Rizi</a> in the Department of Radiology. Prior to joining FMIG, I rotated with <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/translational-medicine/staff/harish-poptani/">Dr. Harish Poptani</a> in the Department of Radiology (now at University of Liverpool). My work focused on implementing a registration protocol for analyzing DTI images of glioblastoma patients. I was also part of the <a href="https://interfaces.seas.upenn.edu/">HHMI Interfaces Program</a>, which emphasizes medical training alongside the traditional engineering curriculum offered by the program.
</p>
</p>

<p>
Before starting my PhD, I worked in Dr. <a href="https://www.lerner.ccf.org/biomedical-engineering/li/#lab-investigator">Xiaojuan Li's</a> lab in the MQIR group at UCSF (now at Cleveland Clinic). My research focused on characterizing osteoarthritic cartilage from human knees using HR-MAS proton NMR spectroscopy. </p>
